# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) 
and [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Project supports CRUD operations for "Servers"

Used AntD Modals, Foms & Layouts for handling data and designs in a smooth manner.

Every API call made via `REACT_APP_BASE_API_ENDPOINT` in .env.

###`Modularised code` 
1. css files in form of `styles.modules.css` make it easier to give ClassNames in files
2. reusable React components help to use fragments of code everywhere
3. folder structure helpful for scaling application using Redux
